# QuickOSC app for Android^TM^

Simple Dirty Quick OSC App

You probably already know what [OSC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control "link") is. Here is a very simple, dirty and quick OSC application which lets you modify OSC messages on your phone/tablet.
I used JavaOSC by [Illposed Software](http://www.illposed.com/software/javaosc.html "link").

## Distribution
The app can be downloaded on the [Google Play Market](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ahmetkizilay.controls.osc "Link").
